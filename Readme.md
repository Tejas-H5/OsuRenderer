# Osu Renderer

This project was made in order to create a cursor accelerator that would be able to play 8*+ slider tech maps using a physics actuation system rather than just robotically lerping between all the points like the default osu! replay.
And I have actually been able to get something that works! Maybe not the best thing in the world, but it's a huge improvement over what we get currently. 
Now all that's left is to shed as much excess scope as possible, and make the program look decent.

The renderer is something I wrote in C# like 5 years ago and then ported several times, so it's probably trash. I may rewrite it later.
