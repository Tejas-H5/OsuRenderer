# Osu Clone

An osu! beatmap renderer made in odin from scratch, mainly to test out my odin renderer

This project points to an osu! directory as specified by you in the `env.odin` file.
Set it to the folder on your computer with all the osu! beatmaps (this is mainly so I'm not hosting music mp3s on github, but also 
has the added benefit of allowing you to open any beatmap you want).


This is an experimental software in it's early stages. 
For a more accurate overview, read TODO.txt, as I can't be bothered keeping this readme updated at this moment, when I am performing a large number of changes.
