Main objectives:

- test my odin renderer, get better at programming, find edges of the Odin language
- more natural looking osu AI movement

TODO:

- Overall product
    - This program can be used to see how this natural AI will play the beatmap
        - [] A seek bar at the bottom that displays a 'difficulty' graph
            - really, it is just the magnitude of the required acceleration. 
            - A bit like the 'most watched' thing on youtube
        - [] Only have 1 AI. make the multiple AIs thing a testing option
            - Remove multiple AIs


- AI improvements
    - [] The AI needs to stream smoothly
    - The AI needs to be able to play 2B maps
        - [] Our miss system needs to be re-evaluated for slider ends and slider repeats
        - [] update the AI
    - [x] AI should also start clicking the circles and sliders. It occasionally misses sometimes, so we should track this too
        - This could be improved. [low priority]
            - [] We can display which key is pressed. 
            - [] We can also alternate if the last keypress happened very recently
            - [] buttons to navigate to [<- prev miss] [next miss ->]


- UI
    - [] It should look a bit better imo
        - [] Background image
            ...
    - [] AI should have sliders and stuff to control their values
        - [] slider ui component
    - [] A G-meter
    - [] Export osu replay files
