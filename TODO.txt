Main objectives:

I now plan on extending the scope of this software by quite a large margin, just to see how far I can actually take it.
That is, both this software and my odin app framework.
Hoping that Draoz gets rename and reference-finding implemented on the LSP at some point, but in the meantime, I will have to get creative.
I no longer want this app to be compatible with osu!. Sure it will be able to load in osu! beatmaps, but I will be adding a lot more gamplay elements, possibly even a singleplayer mode with a storyline, and a lot of other things that won't 100% line up with the original osu! game.


TODO: New things to do

- Improve the underlying odin framework
    - Use render+update in seperate thread feature
    - Move away from immediate mode rendering, switch to images where possible. 
    - Test out the idea of visual tests having a separate render/update method, and an update method that can assert things on it's own and flag failures without rendering
- Start making a playable osu! clone
    - Want to add sliders that you need to drag manually
- Start making a bespoke osu! editor. Going to take a UX > UI
    - Our more natural looking AI can be incorporated here
        - Needs a better algo for streaming. This is hard, so we can tackle it later
        - Should start doing keypresses
        - Should be able to mroe easily navigate between misses
        - Seek bar, it will have a line graph showing acceleration/difficulty spikes based on accel most likely
    - Rotate/scale with same shortcuts
    - SV pallete, ability to scale sliders proportionally to sv, ability to change beat length without changing slider visual
    - Repeats?
    - Hitsounding should be like a DAW
    - Possibly a custom beatmap format. We want to support more features
