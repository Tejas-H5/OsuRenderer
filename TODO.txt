Main objectives:

- test my odin renderer, get better at programming, find edges of the Odin language
- more natural looking osu AI movement

TODO:

- AI improvements
    - [] AI should also start clicking the circles and sliders. It occasionally misses sometimes, so we should track this too
        ...

- UI
    - [] It should look a bit better imo
        - [] Background image
            ...
    - [] AI should have sliders and stuff to control their values
    - [] A G-meter
    - [] Export osu replay files
