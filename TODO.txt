Main objectives:

- test my odin renderer, get better at programming, find edges of the Odin language
- more natural looking osu AI movement

TODO:

- AI improvements
    - the 'smoothing' AI should calculate a point on the 'inside' of the angle formed by p0p1p2, rather than the point that is closest.
        also, it should check both the center of the circle, and the 'inside' point and choose whichever is closer. 
    - 

automod:

- General issues
    - [] song playback desyncs if I scroll far enough, not sure why :(
        - 
    - [] the slider head should disappear after I've clicked it. I am currently rendering the slider as one thing, but the head and body will need to disappear separately
    - [] the AI shouldn't miss circles
    - [] we need a way to 'click' on the circles and stuff
    - [] we should use the normal appdata/local/osu/songs folder rather than whatever ours is.
